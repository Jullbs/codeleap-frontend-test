# 🖥️ Codeleap Front-End Test

### 🖱️ What?
It’s a web application simulating a social network. It consists of a Home page where you can enter your username and a Feed page where you can see all the posts available, enter a new post, edit or delete your previous posts.
This project was developed using:
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- Typescript
- Tailwind

### ⌨️ How?
 It uses axios and swr to fetch, edit and delete the posts from the api.
 2. React infinite scroll component to deal with the feed.
 3. React hook form and zod were used to deal with form and validation.
 4. Radix ui was used to deal with the modals.
 5. Date-fns to deal with the date formatting.
 6. React toastify for the notifications.
